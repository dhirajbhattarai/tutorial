# What is data science?

Data Science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data.

# What is data science used for?

Data science is used to study data in four main ways.

**1. Descriptive Analysis**

Examines data to gain insights into what happened/happenning by data visualization such as pie charts, bar charts, line plots, tables or generated narratives.

**2. Diagnostic Analysis**

Deep/detailed data examination to understand why something happened by using data mining, discovery and correlations.

**3. Predictive Analysis**

Uses historical data to make accurate forecasts about data patterns that may occur in the future, using machine learning, forecasting, pattern matching and predictive modeling.

**4. Prescriptive Analysis**

Predict the future outcomes and prescibe an optimum response to that outcome, using AI/Machine Learning to recommend the best course of action.

# What are the data science techniques?

**1. Classification**

Sorting of data into specific groups or categories.

**2. Regression**

Finding a relationship between two seemingly unrelated data points.

**3. Clustering**
