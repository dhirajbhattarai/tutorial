# How much time does it take to a absolute layman to learn all these things and start a career?

Great question‚Äîand an important one. The time it takes to become job-ready as a data scientist from an **absolute beginner** depends on several factors, including your background, study pace, and career goals. Here's a realistic breakdown:

---

## ‚è≥ Realistic Time Estimates

| Learning Pace | Hours/Week | Estimated Time to Job-Ready |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Full-time     | 30‚Äì40 hrs  | **6‚Äì9 months**              |
| Part-time     | 10‚Äì15 hrs  | **12‚Äì18 months**            |
| Very casual   | < 5 hrs    | **2+ years**                |

> üí° ‚ÄúJob-ready‚Äù means you can build and explain models, clean data, answer business questions, and present insights‚Äîeven if you don‚Äôt know everything.

* Regression, classification, model evaluation
* Projects and mini-case studies
* Basic SQL

### üîπ **6‚Äì9 months**: Advanced Practice

* End-to-end portfolio projects (e.g., churn prediction, NLP)
* Deep learning intro (optional but good)
* More advanced ML (XGBoost, hyperparameter tuning)
* Dashboarding & communication
* Practice with real datasets (Kaggle, public APIs)

### üîπ **9‚Äì12 months**: Job Readiness

* Polish portfolio & GitHub
* Resume & LinkedIn optimized
* Mock interviews & coding challenges

## ‚úÖ Tips to Speed Up Progress

1. **Stick to a structured path**: Don‚Äôt jump randomly between topics. Use a roadmap.
2. **Projects > theory**: Apply what you learn. Build mini-projects early.
3. **Get feedback**: Join communities (Kaggle, Reddit, LinkedIn groups).
4. **Focus on problem-solving**: Learn how to **think with data**, not just code.
5. **Don‚Äôt wait to apply**: You don‚Äôt need to know *everything* to start applying for junior/analyst roles.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:

* **You do *not* need to master everything before starting**.
* Many successful data scientists start with analyst or junior roles and grow on the job.
