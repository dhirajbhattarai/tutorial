# List out all the topics i need to learn to be a data scientist

Becoming a **Data Scientist** requires a blend of skills across programming, statistics, machine learning, and domain knowledge. Here's a comprehensive roadmap divided into key topic areas, from foundational to advanced.

---

## 📚 1. **Mathematics & Statistics**

These are the backbone of data science:

* **Linear Algebra**: vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, SVD
* **Calculus**: partial derivatives, gradients, optimization
* **Probability Theory**:

  * Random variables, distributions (normal, binomial, etc.)
  * Bayes’ theorem
* **Statistics**:

  * Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance)
  * Inferential statistics (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals)
  * Correlation vs. causation

---

## 🖥️ 2. **Programming (Python preferred)**

You need to code data pipelines and models:

* **Core Python**: data types, loops, functions, OOP
* **Libraries**:

  * `NumPy`, `Pandas` – data manipulation
  * `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly` – visualization
  * `Scikit-learn` – machine learning
  * `Statsmodels` – statistical modeling
  * `TensorFlow` / `PyTorch` – deep learning (advanced)

Optional:

* **R** – widely used in statistics and academia

---

## 📊 3. **Data Handling & Analysis**

Working with real data is essential:

* Data wrangling & cleaning (handling missing values, outliers)
* Data exploration (EDA)
* Feature engineering
* Working with structured (CSV, SQL) and unstructured data (text, images)
* Time series data (resampling, trend/seasonality)

---

## 📈 4. **Machine Learning**

Learn to build predictive models:

* **Supervised Learning**:

  * Regression: Linear, Logistic
  * Classification: Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes
* **Unsupervised Learning**:

  * Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical
  * Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, t-SNE
* **Model Evaluation**:

  * Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
  * Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning
* **Ensemble Methods**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
* **Model Interpretability**: SHAP, LIME

---

## 🧠 5. **Deep Learning (Optional but Valuable)**

For advanced projects like NLP and computer vision:

* Neural networks basics (perceptrons, backpropagation)
* CNNs for images
* RNNs, LSTMs for sequences
* Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT)
* Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch

---

## 🗃️ 6. **Databases & Data Engineering**

Understanding where and how data is stored:

* **SQL** (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, subqueries)
* NoSQL (MongoDB basics)
* ETL pipelines
* Working with large datasets (Dask, PySpark)

---

## 🌐 7. **Big Data Tools & Cloud Platforms**

Common in enterprise settings:

* Hadoop, Spark
* AWS (S3, SageMaker), GCP (BigQuery), Azure
* Data lakes vs. warehouses

---

## 📂 8. **Version Control & Project Workflow**

Working on teams and managing code:

* Git & GitHub
* Virtual environments (venv, conda)
* Reproducibility & documentation
* Jupyter Notebooks vs. Scripts

---

## 📊 9. **Data Visualization & Communication**

You must present your findings effectively:

* Building dashboards (Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly Dash)
* Storytelling with data
* Business intelligence fundamentals

---

## 🧪 10. **Projects & Real-World Practice**

Build a portfolio with projects like:

* Predictive modeling
* Recommendation systems
* NLP projects (e.g., sentiment analysis)
* Time series forecasting
* Kaggle competitions

---

## 🧠 11. **Soft Skills & Business Acumen**

* Problem-solving mindset
* Communication & presentation
* Understanding business goals
* Working with stakeholders

---

## 📘 Bonus: Topics to Explore Later

* A/B testing
* Causal inference
* Reinforcement learning
* MLOps (model deployment and monitoring)
* Ethics and bias in AI
